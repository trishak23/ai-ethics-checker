# AI Ethics Checker (Prototype)

A lightweight, rule-based prototype for evaluating ethical risks in AI systems using
interpretable heuristics.

This tool is designed for **educational, academic, and early-stage auditing purposes**
and is **not a legal or regulatory compliance engine**.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The AI Ethics Checker evaluates datasets and metadata across three ethical dimensions:

- **Fairness** – Detects imbalance across sensitive attributes
- **Transparency** – Checks availability of essential documentation
- **Accountability** – Assesses responsibility and traceability mechanisms

Each dimension is scored on a **0–10 scale**, and an overall ethics score is computed.
